Van Life was created to cement React principles, as well learn the popular library, React Router. Van Life is currently in very early stages; my next steps with this project will be to redevelop it using NextJS and Supabase, as well as an overall redesign using MaterialUI to update the current responsiveness. Currently, the app features only a fake form of authentication. To log in and access the host tab, please use the following login:

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
